# mpm-bash
A bash script that interacts with MATLAB Package Manager (command line installer for MATLAB.)
Notes:
- You need an internet connection to use this.
- If don't want to install all products, you need to use the same syntax as MPM to specify the products you want (ex: MATLAB Simulink MATLAB_Parallel_Server)
- Now supports R2024a!
